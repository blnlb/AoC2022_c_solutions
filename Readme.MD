# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions
## Solutions are in C
This may seem unintuitive, and indeed it sucks usually. But the puzzles are usually pretty amenable to i/o flows using C. 

Each year, I find it challenging to limit myself in this way. Any data structures I build in one puzzle out of frustration, like doubly linked lists or queues, can be pulled and used for others. I may create some header files this year as I go along, updating them with different structures, constructs, useful globals. You'll eventually see them in an upper-level folder.

## Optimizations
I'm not trying to optimize a whole lot here. I have leetcode for that.

That said, I'll provide time and estimated time complexities in readmes for each day. I'm not a computer science person, so all I can give is best guess.
